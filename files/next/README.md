# About this report

We recently conducted research to support federal agencies’ COVID-19 response efforts and better understand gaps and opportunities within the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/).

We interviewed 60 government content managers, designers, engineers, and other subject matter experts to understand how agencies use the design system in emergency response situations and beyond. The research resulted in the release of [11 components and page templates for emergency response](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/releases/tag/v2.10.0). It also surfaced several ways the design system can support agencies now and into the future.

[Read the report](Transforming-the-American-digital-experience-v0.1-DRAFT.pdf) (PDF, 947 KB, Draft v0.1, January 2021) included in this directory to learn how teams are using the design system and how, together, we can improve government services and transform the American digital experience. Throughout the report, we list opportunities to get involved and prompts to investigate ways to move these efforts forward.

Have a story related to using the design system? Whether it’s a big win or a roadblock, we want to hear it! Please email us at uswds@support.digitalgov.gov.
